# sketch2react-core-assistant

There are/will be two framework assistants - one for Sketch2React's framework and one for Stratos
Components' framework. This is because the frameworks differ slightly from one another.

This assistant contains rules that are common between the two framework assistants. These rules are
also general enough to be useful for others I hope :) I've made them configurable as per
documentation recommendation. This assistant has no config-rules. It's meant for extending.
