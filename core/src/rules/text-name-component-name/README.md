# text-name-component-name

Text name must contain one pair of curly brackets. Texts which are made exportable are excluded.

## Rationale

Curly brackets are used within the [Sketch2React](https://sketch2react.gitbook.io/sketch2react-io/)
framework to define component name i.e. {text}. Incorrect number of square brackets will cause
parsing errors.

## Options

None.
